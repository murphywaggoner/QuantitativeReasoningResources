[Math in Society](http://www.opentextbookstore.com/mathinsociety/) *A survey of mathematics for the liberal arts major*

Math in Society is a free, open textbook. This book is a survey of contemporary mathematical topics, 
most non-algebraic, appropriate for a college-level quantitative literacy topics course for liberal arts majors. 
The text is designed so that most chapters are independent, allowing the instructor to choose a selection of topics 
to be covered. Emphasis is placed on the applicability of the mathematics. Core material for each topic is covered in 
the main text, with additional depth available through exploration exercises appropriate for in-class, group, or 
individual investigation.
